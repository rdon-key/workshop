# Soldering/assembly

The following describes soldering and assembly.
For each item, some work on the front side and some work on the back side.
The badge below indicates the orientation at the start of work, so please refer to it. 

* ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f)
* ![Work surface - back](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-back-a42e4f)


## Assembling the work bench

Assemble the work bench to make soldering smoother.
If you have the person next to you hold the bottom plate, assembly will go more smoothly, so please work together.

![](./images/bg01.jpg)

Screw the `solder supports` to the bottom part of the case. Perform the action on a flat and stable surface like a table. This is the `workbench mode`.


## ![Work surface - back](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-back-a42e4f) insert the diodes x 12

Use the `diode bender` to bend the diodes and insert them into the back of PCB.

![](./images/bg06.jpg)

Please pay attention to the orientation of the diodes as they have polarity and will not work if inserted the wrong way.
As shown in the photo on the right, match the direction of the silk-printed triangular mark with the direction of the black side of the diode (arrow). 

![](./images/bg07.jpg)
![](./images/bg08.jpg)

Solder one side.
If the position is significantly off, heat it again to melt the solder and adjust the position.

![](./images/bg09.jpg)

Complete once both sides are soldered.

![](./images/bg10.jpg)



Once all soldering is done, turn it over and cut the legs with pliers or similar.

![](./images/bg31.jpg)


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Resistor x 2

Solder one side.
Resistors have no orientation.
If the position is significantly off, heat it again to melt the solder and adjust the position.

![](./images/bg22.jpg)

Complete once both sides are soldered.
Once all soldering is done, turn it over and cut the legs with pliers or similar.


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Pin sockets

Place the pin sockets (1x8 x 2 + 1x7 x 1) on the board.

![](./images/bg02.jpg)

Insert the pin header that comes with the RP2040 Zero.
As shown in the picture, the longer pin will be on the bottom, and insert the longer one into the socket.
This will allow you to achieve a vertical alignment.

![](./images/bg03.jpg)

Place the RP2040 Zero and solder only one pin.
Once soldered, check the position/orientation, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.
Make sure it is inserted firmly and deeply.

![](./images/bg04.jpg)

Once all the pins have been soldered, remove them from the socket.

![](./images/bg05.jpg)


## ![Work surface - back](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-back-a42e4f) RGB LED (SK6812MINI-E)

The correct orientation of the LEDs is to match the notch on one of its legs to the corner of the solkscreen.

![](./images/bg10_detail.jpg)


## ![Work surface - back](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-back-a42e4f) Key switch socket

Place the socket along the silk.  

![](./images/bg11.jpg)

The sockets circled in red in the photo below are in the opposite direction.

![](./images/key_socket_miss.jpg)

First, solder one side.
Firmly heat the land (board side) and then melt the solder.
Once the solder has melted, press the socket down with your finger while wearing the gauntlet.
Soldering must be completed when the socket is firmly attached to the board.
Once soldering is complete, check the position/direction, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.

![](./images/bg12.jpg)
![](./images/bg13.jpg)

Next, solder the other side. 

![](./images/bg14.jpg)


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Joystick


Once you place the joystick, solder the part indicated by the arrow.
Once soldering is complete, check that it is firmly attached, and if not, melt the solder and adjust the position.

![](./images/bg15.jpg)

Solder another pin.

![](./images/bg16.jpg)

## ![Work surface - back](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-back-a42e4f) Joystick

Turn it over and solder all the parts.
You can omit soldering the four points indicated by the arrows (you can also solder them).
 

![](./images/bg17.jpg)


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Grove connector

Solder only the pin indicated by the arrows.
After soldering, check the position/direction, and if necessary, melt the solder to adjust it.


![](./images/bg18.jpg)

Next, stop the pin indicated by the arrow so that there are two pins remaining.
After soldering, check the position/direction, and if necessary, melt the solder to adjust it. 

![](./images/bg19.jpg)

Solder the remaining pins.


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) L-shaped pin socket 2x6

Same as the Grove connector, solder only one pin.
After soldering, check the position/orientation, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.

![](./images/bg20.jpg)

Next, stop the pin with the arrow so that two pins are fixed.
After soldering, check the position/orientation, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.

![](./images/bg21.jpg)

Solder the remaining pins from the back side.


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Rotary encoder

It can be inserted from either the front or back, so be careful of the orientation.
Insert it into the board from the front side.
In this case, it is easier to remove it from the workbench and insert it.
Pay attention to the direction you insert it (the rotating part should be on the same side as the joystick).
Check from the back to make sure it is inserted properly.

![](./images/bg23.jpg)

Just like the Grove connector, solder only one pin.
After soldering, check the position/orientation, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.

![](./images/bg24.jpg)

Solder the second pin.
After soldering, check the position/orientation, and melt the solder to adjust it if necessary.

![](./images/bg25.jpg)

Solder the remaining pins.


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f) Microcontroller socket

Insert the socket (1x8 x 2 + 1x7 x 1) and place the microcontroller (this will make it vertical).
If necessary, secure it with masking tape, etc.
You can also have the person next to you hold it down from the back and solder it. Please cooperate and proceed as needed.

![](./images/bg26.jpg)

Solder from the back in the order ① → ② → ③.
Check that each pin is properly inserted, and melt the solder and adjust the position as necessary.

![](./images/bg27.jpg)

Solder the remaining pins.


## ![Work surface - front](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_surface-front-2ea44f)  LCD display

Lightly insert the LCD display into the board (don't insert it all the way, just insert it a little).

![](./images/bg28.jpg)

Take it off the workbench and remove the protective film.
The protective film is not removed in the photo, but please remove it at this point.
Attach the case.
Adjust the LCD position if it is clearly not in the right position.
Push the case in until it fits firmly into the board (you cannot do this while it is still on the workbench).

![](./images/bg29.jpg)

Flip it over and solder it.
Here too, attach only one pin, turn it over and check, and repeat this process.
Check that each pin is inserted properly, and melt the solder if necessary to adjust the position.

![](./images/bg30.jpg)

Complete when all 4 pins are soldered.

# Assembly from here

## Key switch

Insert it so that it sticks in.

Since it is hot swappable, it is easy to check by inserting it while Vial's matrix tester is running.

A common mistake is that the legs do not stick in properly.

Remove it once, straighten the legs, and try again.

## Key cap

Insert it so that it sticks in.

There is actually a direction (vertical and horizontal), but you don't need to worry about that.

## Joystick knob, rotary encoder knob

Insert it straight from above.

Be careful not to touch the LCD display when removing it.

## Microcomputer

Insert it so that it sticks in.

When removing it, loosen it little by little with tweezers or something similar. 

## Screws

Be careful not to overtighten it.
It is best to have very little force required to turn the screws.
If there is a gap between the board and the case, adjust it by hand, rather than tightening the screws.

# Check everything is working

Download the following firmware (`*.uf2`) and check.

## How to flash the firmware

1. Connect the microcontroller and PC with a USB-C cable. 
2. Open Explorer and check that it is recognized as USB mass storage (it should appear as `RPI-RP2`). 
3. Drag and drop the downloaded firmware into the USB mass storage.

Turn the rotary encoder and check that the RGB LED lights up and the volume changes.
Press other keys as appropriate and check that the LED lights up.

You can also check with Vial's matrix tester.
You can also check key bindings from Vial.
